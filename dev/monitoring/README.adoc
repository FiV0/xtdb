# Dev Node Monitoring

This setup uses Docker Compose to spin up the following services:

- **Prometheus** (metrics collection)
- **Grafana** (visualization, with preloaded dashboards and Prometheus data source)

## Dashboard Setup

Grafana is configured to:

- Use Prometheus as its default data source
- Automatically load dashboards from `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/`

## Prometheus Configuration

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from `localhost:8080`. This assumes that the service being monitored:

- Exposes Prometheus metrics at `:8080/metrics`
- Is reachable **from the Prometheus container** via:
  - `172.17.0.1:8080`

### Scraping Multiple Nodes

To monitor multiple XTDB nodes or services, you'll need to:

1. **Expose each node's healthz/metrics endpoint on a discoverable port**
2. **Update `prometheus.yml`** with static targets or service discovery that includes those nodes

Example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'xtdb-nodes'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['172.17.0.1:8080', '172.17.0.1:8081']
```
