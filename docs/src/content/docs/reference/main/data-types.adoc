title: XTDB Data Types
---

The following types are available within XTDB:

== Numeric Types

`SMALLINT`:: 16-bit signed integer
`INT` | `INTEGER`:: 32-bit signed integer
`BIGINT`:: 64-bit signed integer
`FLOAT` | `REAL`:: 32-bit (IEEE single-precision) floating-point number
`DOUBLE`:: 64-bit (IEEE double-precision) floating-point number

=== Decimal type

`NUMERIC` | `DECIMAL`:: fixed-point numeric type with user-defined precision and scale.

We recommend to store decimals with an explicit 32 precision or 64 precision as other precisions still
have a bitwidth of 128 and 256 respectively once stored.

Decimal operations follow consistent rules for precision and scale:

Precision Rules::
* If both operands have precision ≤ 32 → result precision = 32
* Otherwise → result precision = 64 (assuming the result fits a precision 64 decimal)

Scale Rules::
* Addition (`+`) → scale = max(s1, s2)
* Subtraction (`-`) → scale = max(s1, s2)
* Multiplication (`*`) → scale = s1 + s2
* Division (`/`) → scale = max(6, s1 + s2 + 1)

Comparison Operations::
Standard comparison operators are supported for decimals:
+
`<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>`, `<>`
+

Functions like `MAX` and `MIN` return results based on the input operand types.

Type Widening::
Operations between `DECIMAL` and non-`DECIMAL` types uses the following rules:
* Integer operand types get converted to decimal before the operation.
* Floating operand types results in the decimal part being converted to a floating point before the operation.

Casting::
Explicit casts to `DECIMAL` types are honoured in storage and computation:
+
* `::DECIMAL(p, s)` → Precision = `p`, Scale = `s`
* `::DECIMAL(p)` → Precision = `p`, Scale = `0`
* `::DECIMAL` (unspecified) → Defaults to `DECIMAL(64, 9)`

Cast Behaviour::
* Casting from a non-decimal to `::DECIMAL` uses the default precision and scale unless specified.
* Casting from an existing decimal with `::DECIMAL` (unspecified) is a no-op — the original precision and scale are preserved.

Examples::
* `CAST(123.45 AS DECIMAL(5,2))` → `DECIMAL(5,2)`
* `CAST(123 AS DECIMAL(5))` → `DECIMAL(5,0)`
* `CAST(123.456 AS DECIMAL)` → `DECIMAL(64,9)` (unless already `DECIMAL`)

Edge Case Limitation::
Addition of large `DECIMAL` values near the 32-precision boundary may require a precision-64 result.
+
* If an operation would overflow a precision-32 result, an exception is raised, even though precision-64 types are generally supported. The reasoning here is that we try to preserve the original precision. If a larger precision is needed use an explicit cast.

== Date/time types

`DATE`:: date without time.
+
e.g. `DATE '2007-06-29'`
`TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE]`:: date and time, without a time-zone offset.
+
* SQL standard: `TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01 00:00:00'`
** extension: without time-part: `TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01'` - defaults to midnight
* ISO8601: `TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01T00:00:00'`
** without seconds: `TIMESTAMP [WITHOUT TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01T18:00'`

`TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`:: date and time, with a time-zone offset.
+
* SQL standard: `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE '2020-01-01 18:00:00+00:00'`
* ISO8601 (`WITH TIMEZONE` optional):
** `TIMESTAMP [WITH TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01T18:00:00Z'`
** `TIMESTAMP [WITH TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01T18:00:00+00:00'`
** `TIMESTAMP [WITH TIMEZONE] '2020-08-01T18:00:00+01:00[Europe/London]'`
** without time-part: `TIMESTAMP [WITH TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01Z'` - defaults to midnight
** without seconds: `TIMESTAMP [WITH TIMEZONE] '2020-01-01T18:00Z'`

`TIME [WITHOUT TIMEZONE]`::
time-of-day, without a time-zone offset.
+
e.g. `TIME '22:15:04.1237'`

`DURATION`:: (SQL extension) a fixed amount of time.
+
Days are assumed to be 24 hours, months and years are not supported.
+
* ISO8601: `DURATION 'PT1H3M5.533S'`

`INTERVAL`:: a value representing the difference between two timestamps
+
Intervals can either be expressed as years/months or days/hours/minutes/seconds (although these cannot overlap).
Years are assumed to be 12 months, no other assumptions are either made or allowed.
+
* SQL standard: `INTERVAL '1 3' YEAR TO MONTH`, `INTERVAL '163 12:00:00' DAY TO SECOND`
* ISO8601: `INTERVAL 'P1Y3M'`, `INTERVAL 'P163DT12H'`

`PERIOD`:: a pair of timestamps representing a temporal range, with inclusive start and exclusive end ('closed-open').
+
* `PERIOD(DATE '1998-01-05', DATE '1998-01-12')`
* `PERIOD(TIMESTAMP '1998-01-05T12:00:00Z', TIMESTAMP '1998-01-12T15:00:00Z')`


=== Conversions between temporal types

There are a number of considerations when casting between temporal types:

* Casting from `DATE` to `TIMESTAMP` assumes the start of the day.
* Casting to `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` will use the system default time zone.
* When explicitly casting to most temporal types, can specify an optional fractional precision to truncate the value to:
** In SQL, the syntax for this would be `CAST(value AS TYPE(<precision>))`.
* Casting to/from `VARCHAR` involves formatting or parsing as ISO8601 strings.
* Intervals have specific casting behaviors, which are detailed in the next section.

=== Casting between Intervals

Explicitly casting between intervals is supported, but only between **intervals of the same type**.
When casting between intervals, it is required to specify an interval qualifier, otherwise the cast operation will not do anything.

Casting to an interval qualifier will:

* **Normalize** the interval to the new qualifier
+
i.e. if an Interval of `25 hours` is cast to `DAY TO HOUR`, it will be normalized to `1 day 1 hour`.
* **Truncate** the interval to the new qualifier
+
i.e. if an Interval of `25 hours` is cast to `DAY`, it will be truncated to `1 day`.

=== Casting to/from Intervals

When casting to/from intervals from other types, the following rules apply:

* Casting from `VARCHAR` to an interval:
** **Without** specifying an interval qualifier: will parse the string as an ISO8601 interval, and will return a day-time interval.
** **With** an interval qualifier: will parse the string and output the type of interval based on the qualifier.
* Casting from an `INTERVAL` to `VARCHAR` will format the interval as an ISO8601 string.
* Casting from an `INTERVAL` to `DURATION`:
** Will only work if the interval is a day-time interval.
** Will return the entire interval as its ISO 8601 duration - any days will be converted to 24 hours.
* Casting from a `DURATION` to `INTERVAL`:
** Always returns a day-time interval.
** **Without** specifying an interval qualifier: always returns with zero days and put the whole duration into the time part of the interval.
** **With** an interval qualifier: will normalize and truncate the duration according to the interval qualifier (will normalize hours to days, with 1 day = 24 hours, if qualifier contains `DAY`).

== Other scalar types

`BOOLEAN`:: 3-valued boolean: TRUE, FALSE or NULL
`VARBINARY`:: a variable-length byte array
+
e.g. `X('41af8e01')`

`VARCHAR` | `TEXT`:: a variable-length character array
+
e.g.:
+
* `'hello world!'`
* `+E'hello\n world!'+` - string containing C-style escape characters:
** `\ooo`: octal
** `\xXX`, `\uXXXX`, `\UXXXXXXXX`: 2, 4 or 8 hex digits
** `\r`, `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\'`
* `\$$dollar quoted string$$`: no need to escape single/double quotes etc in here.
** dollars can also contain a tag, for nesting purposes: `$mytag$...$mytag$`

`URI`::
+
e.g. `URI 'https://xtdb.com'`
`UUID`::
+
e.g. `UUID '97a392d5-5e3f-406f-9651-a828ee79b156'`

== Collection Types

XTDB supports arbitrarily nested data in a first-class way, without needing to store it as JSON:

`ARRAY`:: an ordered list of values
+
e.g.
+
* `ARRAY[1, 2, 3]`
* `[1, 2, 3]`

`OBJECT` | `RECORD`:: a mapping of keys to values:
+
e.g.
+
* `OBJECT(name: 'Lucy', age: 38)`
* `RECORD(name: 'Lucy', age: 38)`
* `{name: 'Lucy', age: 38}`
