title: Standard Library
---

XTDB provides a rich standard library of predicates and functions, available in both XTQL and SQL query languages.

The standard library documentation is split into two sections:

* link:stdlib/xtql[XTQL Standard Library] - Functions and control structures available in XTQL
* link:stdlib/sql[SQL Standard Library] - Functions and control structures available in SQL

Some functions are available in both languages but may have slightly different syntax. These are documented in both sections.
