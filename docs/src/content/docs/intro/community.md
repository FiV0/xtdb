XTDB is fundamentally free-to-use and open-source (under the [MPL license](https://opensource.org/license/mpl-2-0/)).

For your peace of mind, though, XTDB is the flagship product of [JUXT](https://juxt.pro) - a widely-respected software consultancy who have been building high-quality, scalable and resilient software for some of the world's largest (and smallest!) companies for over ten years.

JUXT additionally provide [enterprise XTDB support](https://xtdb.com/support) for companies looking to adopt or extend their usage of XTDB - including training, consultancy and production support.

## Open-source community

XTDB has an active open-source community on the [XTDB GitHub repo](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb), for:

- issues and pull requests
- [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/xtdb/discussions),
- [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/xtdb/projects/13/views/16),

as well as the source-code itself.

You can get in touch with the XTDB team (privately) regarding any of the above at <hello@xtdb.com>.
