== Building a local image for testing

* Make sure to install docker buildx (`docker-buildx` package in Arch Linux)
* Make sure your Docker daemon is running
* `./bin/build-standalone-image.sh [--clean]` will build and tag as `xtdb/xtdb:latest`, and load it into your images list.
  The `--clean` flag can be used to ensure the xtdb uberjar is rebuilt.
* To run: `docker run -ti --rm -p 5432:5432 xtdb/xtdb` (this will run the server, exposing port 5432)

== Customizing the local image

If you wish to build the local image with a different default configuration included, you can change the content of the `standalone/local_config.edn` file prior to building, or create a new file and replace references to `local_config.edn` with the new config file.
The created uberjar should have all XTDB modules included, so the node can be configured however you wish.

== Docker compose setup

There is a docker compose setup under link:docker-compose[docker-compose]. It uses https://min.io/[minio] for object storage and confluence kafka (with KRaft, so no Zookeper needed). You need to run `./bin/build-docker-compose-image.sh` once so that the proper docker image gets build. The image contains the aws xtdb jar, but has some config tweaked especially for `minio`. It should then be as simple as running `docker-compose up` in the `docker-compose` folder.
